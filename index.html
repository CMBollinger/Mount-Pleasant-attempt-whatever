            <h1>About Us </h1>
            <p>The Mt. Pleasant Animal Shelter is a city operated facility with one full time director, 1 full time animal 
            control officer, one part time animal control officer and many dedicated volunteers. We take in stray, 
            abandoned, injured, and homeless dogs that are within the city limits of Mt. Pleasant. We are unable to 
            take in cats unless they are injured or un able to care for them selves, such as un-weaned, and 
            motherless kittens. Unfortunately, there is no state law or city ordinance against cats running at large at 
            this time. Our animal control officers are responsible for responding to calls for service relating to dogs 
            at large, dog bites, and animal cruelty. Pet owners, please don’t let your dogs roam at large at any time 
            and keep a collar with a current rabies tag on them at all times. Provide your pet with access to food, 
            water, adequate shelter, and vet care, if needed, at all times. This is a state law and a city ordinance. We 
            will issue citations for these violations starting at $193.00. Please be a responsible pet owner. Dogs and 
            cats already spayed or neutered at the time of adoption will have an adoption fee of $75 and can go 
            home the same day. Dogs and cats that are not spayed or neutered at the time of adoption will have an 
            adoption fee of $25 . Those animals will then be made a spay or neuter appointment at one of our local 
            vets. We will take them to your choice of local vet and you will be responsible for picking up your new 
            pet and paying for their spay or neuter fee to the vet.</p>
