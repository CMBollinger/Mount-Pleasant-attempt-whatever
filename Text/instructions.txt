Your client wishes for you to build her a 4–5-page website. 
She wants a webpage for home/landing page, adoption, volunteering, and FAQ.
Each webpage needs to:
•	Have navigation tools to access all the webpages on the site
•	A footer with their contact information (found under Mt Pleasant Animal Shelter in the pdf)
The Adoption page needs the following:
•	All the information under Available for Adoption
•	Pictures of each animal matching up with their name
The Volunteer page needs the information under Volunteer Opportunities
The FAQ page needs the information under FAQ
It is up to your discretion for where to put the information from News, About Us. Put them in locations that make sense (even give them their own webpage if you need to). 
The Home/Landing Page is completely up to you for what should go into it. 
The design of the website is under your discretion be creative but make design choices that would be appropriate for a business like this and help make it stand out.
